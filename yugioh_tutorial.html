		<h1>Yugioh Tutorial: The Basics</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<h2>Ruleset</h2>
		<p>The Yugioh Ruleset consists of these basic principles</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are two players, each with 8000 life points (LP for short) this is their Health bar, when it reaches zero that player will lose</li>
			<li>Each player starts with 5 cards</li>
			<li>There are 2 decks for each player their main deck which consists of normal,effect,spell and trap cards which can go up to a max of 60 and a minimum of 40 cards</li>
			<li>There is the extra deck which has a minimum of 0 and max of 15 cards, this consists of only monsters those being Fusion,Synchro,Xyz, and Link.</li>
			<li>If a player runs out of cards to draw, they will also lose the duel<li>
			<li>The game consists of 6 phases, draw,standby,main,battle,main 2, and end</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The draw phase is where the player draws one card from their main deck, the player who plays the first turn of the game does not draw in their draw phase</li>
				<li>The standby phase is where nothing happens unless a cards effect activates during that phase<li>
				<li>The main phase is where the player summons monsters, activates spells and traps to allow the player to employ their straegy</li>
				<li>The battle phase is where the player commands their monsters to attack the other player, however the first of the game the battle phase does not happen</li>
				<ul>
					<li>When battling, the monster with the higher attacks will win always when attacking a monster with a lower attack/defense, only when a monster is attacked in attack mode will a player take damage</li>
					<li>When an attacking monster attacks a monster with a higher defense then the attacking will take damage but niether card will be destoryed</li>
					<li>When attacking a monster with the same attack, both monsters will be destoyed</li>
					<li>When the attacking player has no monster to attack, they will attack the player directly for their LP</li>
				</ul>
				<li>The main phase 2 is the exact same as main phase 1</li>
				<li>The end phase is where the player ends their turn, cards effect that require the end phase activate here</li>
			</ul>
			<li>You can summon is various ways, the main two are normal and special summons</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal summoning consists of player placing a card on the field from their hand only, it can only be once per turn</li>
				<li>Special summoning consists of a player placing card on the field from their hand and deck depending on a cards effect, it can be done as many times per turn</li>
				<li>Flip summoning is where when a monster card face down is flipped face up, this is usally done to activate an effect</li>
			</ul>
			<li>There are 2 places can a card can go depending on how the card is removed, banishment zone, and the graveyard</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The graveyard is where a card goes after being destoryed or used, effects that have graveyard requirements can be used there</li>
				<li>The banishment zone is where a card goes after being banished, it similar to the graveyard effects can be used here, however cards can be placed face down making them unplayable</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The field consists of zones, 5 for normal and effect monsters, 5 for spells and traps (2 of which pendulum monsters go on), 1 for a field spell, 1 for only an extra deck monsters</li>
		</ul>
